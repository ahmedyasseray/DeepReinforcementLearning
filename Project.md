### Abstract

This study tries to answer the question of whether non-gradient-based
evolutionary and swarm intelligence algorithms can work for hard Deep
Reinforcement Learning Tasks. Here weights of the neural networks are evolved
using gradient free techniques like particle swarm optimization and genetic
algorithms. The performance of the approach is compared with A3C, DQN and Random
Search in terms of expected discounted future return, computation time and data
efficiency.
