# DeepReinforcementLearning
Contains codes and reports of running Deep RL techniques on standard simulated environments like openAI Gym, Mujoco etc. The repository will be updated from time to time.

Many of the initial algorithms are solved assignments from UC Berkley, [CS 294 deep reinforcement learning fall 2017 Course](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse-fa17/index.html). 
1. Homework 1 : Imitation Learning
2. Homework 2 : Policy Gradients
3. Homework 3 : DQN
4. Homework 4 : Model Based RL
